        <p>
          The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, a subset of the
          Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web
          browser. Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet,
          and use these terms interchangeably. However, the term Internet
          actually refers to the global network of servers that makes the
          information sharing that happens over the Web possible. So, although
          the Web does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not
          one and same.
